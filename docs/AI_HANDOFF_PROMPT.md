You are helping me work on a project called OpsBrain AI.

OpsBrain AI is an agentic AI system for logistics operations analysis.
It uses:
- PostgreSQL as the factual data source
- SQL for all data retrieval
- LLMs only for reasoning, explanation, and planning
- A modular, multi-agent architecture

The project follows a “one pain at a time” strategy.
Each pain is implemented as a separate module with:
- KPIs
- SQL queries
- Reasoning logic
- Documentation

I am responsible for Pain Module 2: <DEFINE PAIN HERE>.
My responsibilities are:
- Define business KPIs for this pain
- Write SQL queries using the `deliveries` table
- Design reasoning logic and explanations
- Document insights clearly

Constraints:
- Do NOT redesign core architecture
- Do NOT modify database schema
- Assume clean analytics table already exists
- Focus on business realism, not ML model training

Goal:
Help me design a realistic, enterprise-grade pain module that integrates cleanly into OpsBrain AI.
